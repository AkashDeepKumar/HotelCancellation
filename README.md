Predicting and responding to Hotel Booking Cancellations


Hotel Bookings are mainly a result of Human Behavior, and as we already know, it is pretty challenging to predict human behavior. One of the ever evolving industry to get impacted by this is the Hospitality Industry.
From a customer standpoint, we know that there are both internal and external factors that contribute to the decision to cancel a hotel reservation. In contrast, it may not be possible to learn more about why customers cancel hotel reservations or to even forecast the decision of a particular customer. Hence we can leverage Machine learning algorithms to look for patterns and trends to learn more about hotel booking cancellations done by a larger population.
